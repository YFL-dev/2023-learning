## What is TDD? What is a test suite?

TDD: is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code.

1. Write a test
2. Write the code
3. Run tests
4. Modify and/or refactor
5. Repeat

A test suite is a collection of test cass that are intended to be used to test a softare program to show that it has some specified set of behaviors.

### How to use Jest?

## What is code formatter?

A code formatter is a tool that automatically formats source code in a consistent style.

### What is Prettier? How to use Prettier?

## What is linter?

Linter is a tool that analyzes code for potential errors, stylistic issues, deviations from best pratics.

### What is EsLint?

## Formatter vs. Linter

- Formatters (like Prettier) focus mainly on the style and formatting of the code. They ensure that code looks consistent regardless of who wrote it, but they donâ€™t typically enforce coding standards or best practices beyond stylistic concerns.

- Linters (like ESLint), on the other hand, analyze the code for errors and bugs, stylistic issues, and complex code patterns. They are more versatile as they can enforce coding conventions and also detect potential runtime errors.

_While both tools seem to overlap in functionality (especially when it comes to code style), they serve distinct purposes. In many modern JavaScript projects, **Prettier (for formatting) and ESLint (for linting) are used together to ensure that the code is not only stylistically consistent but also free from errors and adheres to best practices**._
